# Introduction

This project is being developed while I'm taking a ReactJS course in CoderHouse. The main goal is to apply the previously acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS, Vanilla JS and the concepts learned on this ReactJS course, to build an eCommerce store.

## Installed dependencies

- react-bootstrap (v2.3.1): helps with the styles of the components and with the responsive developing.
- react-icons (v4.3.1): allows to use icons.
- react-router-dom (v6.3.0): allows to navigate through the components.
- firebase (v9.8.3): works like a database.
- emailjs-com: (v3.2.0): allows to send emails.
